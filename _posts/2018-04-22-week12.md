### Topic TBD

Content TBD

### Team Progress

In class Tuesday I started looking at how to broadcast events, since that was the big thing missing from my attempts at making the torch light you up. I looked [at their docs](https://metaterasology.github.io/docs/developing/networkMultiplayer/networkEvents.html#broadcastevent) and realized I'd probably been approaching it incorrectly from the beginning. Then I realized we'd been making commits directly to our fork instead of creating branches so I tried to make a new branch exactly lke our fork, then revert our fork, but had trouble doing so, so got Ryan to do it. Hopefully from now on our code will be more organized. In class I also noticed that the axe texture was backwards when it was held, so I found the texture after some digging and created a new branch (dev-axe) and made a pull request.

### Contributions this week:

This week I created a [pull request for Terasology](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/3330) because we noticed the axe texture was backwards so I found and edited the texture file. I also did a search in the project in case someone got to the fix before me [but looks like they didn't quite fix it](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/2876).
