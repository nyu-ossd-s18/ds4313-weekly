### Team Progress

In class Tuesday I started looking at how to broadcast events, since that was the big thing missing from my attempts at making the torch light you up. I looked [at their docs](https://metaterasology.github.io/docs/developing/networkMultiplayer/networkEvents.html#broadcastevent) and realized I'd probably been approaching it incorrectly from the beginning. Then I realized we'd been making commits directly to our fork instead of creating branches so I tried to make a new branch exactly lke our fork, then revert our fork, but had trouble doing so, so got Ryan to do it. Hopefully from now on our code will be more organized. In class I also noticed that the axe texture was backwards when it was held, so I found the texture after some digging and created a new branch (dev-axe) and made a pull request.

On Wednesday I made another attempt at fixing the torch bug within the same FirstPersonClientSystem file that I was looking at, making two commits very similar to my first two commits but in a different function that I thought might do the trick. I had to make commits instead of testing locally as my laptop couldn't handle running two instances of Terasology at the same time without lagging terribly. I found that that solution also didn't work so then I began looking into other files dealing with holding items and networking, namely CharacterHeldItemComponent.java, CharacterHeldItemAuthoritySystem.java, CharacterStateEvent.java, CharacterMover.java, and KinematicCharacterMover.java.

Frustratingly enough, on Sunday someone said they might have found [a solution](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/issues/3280#issuecomment-383413841) to the torch issue; they haven't made a PR yet so I'll keep snooping.

### Contributions this week:

This week I created a [pull request for Terasology](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/3330) because we noticed the axe texture was backwards so I found and edited the texture file. I also did a search in the project in case someone got to the fix before me [but looks like they didn't quite fix it](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/2876).
