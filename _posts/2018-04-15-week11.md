### Topic TBD

Content TBD

### Team Progress

In class on Tuesday, we chatted in the discord to ask the members some questions, and also we identified an issue and I fixed it, but then when I checked in with the group, Suyasha showed me a few other issues with the same problem that had better (but uncommited) fixes. I am still messing around with the files related to the issue, but the lack of familiarity with the code base slows me down.

### Contributions this week:

This week I added another hefty contribution to [the Wikipedia page for NYU Shanghai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University_Shanghai), by detailing their plans for a new campus, and reordering two of the topics in the article for better flow.

#### Progress thus far:
  - [Wikipedia Contributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Dorasun): 4 (two new page sections, one fleshed out section, many citation fixes, one added definition, one page reordering)
  - Class Site Contributions: 4 [issues raised](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/created_by/dorasun), 1 [pull request](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Adorasun), 9 [comments](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=commenter%3Adorasun+repo%3Ajoannakl%2Fcs480_s18&type=Issues)
