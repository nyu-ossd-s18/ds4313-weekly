Team assessment and plan
------

#### Meeting times
After some back and forth, the PDF.js team has decided on Wednesdays 6:30-8:30pm, and Saturdays 4-6pm.

#### Challenges
The biggest challenge I can see for us so far is poor communication, it has been kind of hard coordinating conversations when all five of us are busy at different times and may not be online when needed. Coming to a consensus on anything is challenging, as we are all pretty indecisive as well. Suyasha and Ryan both claim to be good at problem solving, Suyasha is also good at persevering, Ryan can break down problems and see things differently, Ola and Ashley offer their experience with web development and Java/Python/JavaScript respectively and documentation, and Ashley additionally offers researching and responsiveness. I think I'm particularly good at keeping track of details, and hopefully can help the team with that, along with researching, Java/Python/JavaScript/Web, and problem solving as well. There might be minor issues with no one on the team being good at leadership or time management or organization, but it could just be that no one thought to write it at the time, we'll see.

#### Milestones
I think the major milestones for this project will be as follows:
  - Complete online walkthrough
  - Install code base and learn how to build the project
  - Understand style guide, code base, file structure, workflow
  - Identify new bugs by testing project
  - Interact with community (join the IRC!)
  - Triage all possible bugs (should be doable as there are 5 of us)
  - Fix as many beginner bugs as we can, or at least ask for guidance to promote activity in resolving bugs
  - Open new issues, make pull requests, confirm that existing pull requests resolve issues
  - Try to fix some more advanced bugs
