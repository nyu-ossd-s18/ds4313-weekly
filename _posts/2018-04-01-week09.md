### Questions for Danna Kelmer from Google

* Google's open source platform has 2000 projects, how is this supported within Google? Does each project get full-time support from Google employees?
* How do you feel about Google's actions regarding FOSTA/SESTA? 
* Is Google planning to expand their open source platform? What actions are they taking in order to do this?

### PDF.js progress:

This week I finished triaging all the issues I could, and started taking a look at other issues that don't involve triaging. A lot of them require a lot of knowledge about the code base, so several of us tried to take a closer look at the source code to try to understand it better. We haven't exactly split up roles or anything like that, but hopefully with five sets of eyes looking at the code, we'll begin to understand it well soon.

### Contributions this week:

This week I have added comments to PDF.js issues that needed triaging: [here](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/issues/7533) and [here](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/issues/9194)
