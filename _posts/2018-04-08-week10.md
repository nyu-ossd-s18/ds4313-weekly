### This week 

### Contributions this week:

This week I have opened [an issue on the class website](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/104), as I noticed there was some inconsistent underlining when I took a look at the syllabus. I also commented on [an issue](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/issues/3307) saying that our group would try to work on it (to claim it before anyone else takes it).

#### Progress thus far:
  - [Wikipedia Contributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Dorasun): 3 (two new page sections, many citation fixes, one added definition)
  - Class Site Contributions: 4 [issues raised](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/created_by/dorasun), 1 [pull request](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Adorasun), 8 [comments](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=commenter%3Adorasun+repo%3Ajoannakl%2Fcs480_s18&type=Issues)
