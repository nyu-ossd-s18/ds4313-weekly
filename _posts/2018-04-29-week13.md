### No Blog Post Due

This week no blog was due

### Team Progress

This week I dedicated more time into looking into the UI problem, with little luck so far. It seems that the person working on the UI dropup never actually committed their changes, so I started looking into a way of determining if the open dropdown would extend past the length of the scrollable area. I also helped Suyasha with the texture of snowshoes and added it into the game.

### Contributions this week:

This week I edited an [article](https://github.com/Terasology/TutorialAssetSystem/wiki/Add-New-Creature/dee8d612c6bfe9a601300e33f3ac84c3ba236a04) in the Terasology wiki, because I was peeking through it and noticed some small typos. I renamed the article to make it consistent with other guides in the wiki, so it's hard to show the changes but [here](https://github.com/Terasology/TutorialAssetSystem/wiki/_compare/af8408baca35617b7486136de7f2edd7e95a726a...dee8d612c6bfe9a601300e33f3ac84c3ba236a04#diff-f7b709bdab619e57605138e87e315536) is the original and [here](https://github.com/Terasology/TutorialAssetSystem/wiki/_compare/af8408baca35617b7486136de7f2edd7e95a726a...dee8d612c6bfe9a601300e33f3ac84c3ba236a04#diff-73bd28d67e2c5254e07ddbe3adcd41dd) is my changed file.
