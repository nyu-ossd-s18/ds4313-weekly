### Contributing to Wikipedia

This week I made [my first contribution to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Dorasun)! I appreciated that when I first made my account, Wikipedia provided a whole bunch of articles that needed grammar fixes or other small edits, but I found that when scanning articles on topics I knew nothing about, I didn't really know how to best edit them! Plus, I wanted my first contribution to be memorable, so instead I decided to look through some topics I had some knowledge about. The first thing that came to mind was volleyball, which is how I stumbled upon the [volleyball WikiProject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Volleyball). I skimmed through some topics, and there was a lot on there that I didn't know anything about (especially the articles on specific players!) but eventually I found [an article on volleyball jargon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball_jargon), and I found a word that I've heard used differently from the definition given on the site, namely, that waffles were also a word for a move similar to the pancake, except done with one's foot (the shoelaces give the pancake a waffle pattern!). So I tentatively made the change, and now it's visible on Wikipedia!
